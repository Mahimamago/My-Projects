# My-Projects
My work on Machine Learning in R

The project is about finding epigenetic signatures of biological ageing. The data consists of information about Histone modifications (Chromosomal changes) and DNA methylation of proliferate
senescent cells at two different CpG site - ageing associated sites (aDMPs) and non-ageing associated sites (non-aDMPs)

This project uses different classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to seggregate the aDMPs from the non-aDMPs based on the given information.
The basis used here is that if the classification models perform well, the aDMPs are considered to be different from non-aDMPs based on histone modifications and DNA methylation i.e.. aDMPs
have an epigenetic signature.

The second part of this project is used to check if the epigenetic signature of the aDMPs exists and varies across proliferating and senescent cells.

Detailed information about this project and the results can be found in the report saved as - "Machine Learning Project Report".
